## Hacktoberfest 2023
Hacktoberfest is a celebration of open-source software, which we are all a advocate for. We believe that you should be able to modify software to work as you need. This is why we are participating in [Hacktoberfest 2023](https://hacktoberfest.com). Successfully making 4 contributions on any participating project will net you some prizes which you can see on the link above.

## How to contribute
You can contribute by adding anything in the month of October; (any other time not be counted as part of the event, but you are still welcome to contribute) in the form of a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Simply make a fork of the project, make your changes, and create a pull request to the main project with those changes.  

Be sure to check the issue board if you're not sure how to help!

We will review your changes, suggest edits if needed, and if all checks out - we will add it to the project. If your additions are accepted, they will be merged to the main branch, and your pull request will be marked as Hacktoberfest accepted!

Generally, any contribution you make will be included at the bottom of this README as credit to your work.
